Administrative
--------------

1.  Review of Newtonian dynamics ≈ 6 lectures
2.  Lagrangian dynamics ≈ 6 lectures
3.  Rigid body motions in 3D ≈ 6 lectures
4.  Aircraft/spacecraft dynamics ≈ 6 lectures
    *   Midterm exam #1 in class (1 hour) after Lecture 6 (15%)
    *   Midterm exam #2 in class (1 hour) after Lecture 14 (20%)

Learning Objectives for Students Graduating from 16.61 will be Able to:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Use methods of vector kinematics to analyze the translation and rotation of rigid bodies - and explain with appropriate visualizations.
2.  Identify appropriate coordinate frames and calculate the transformations between them.
3.  Formulate and solve for the equations of motion using both the Newtonian and Lagrangian formulations.
4.  Use the basic equations of motion to calculate the fundamental flight modes of an aircraft.
5.  Use the basic equations of motion to calculate the attitude motions of a low Earth orbit spacecraft.

Measurable Outcomes for Students Graduating from 16.61 will be Able to:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Derive the equations of motion in accelerating and rotating frames.
2.  Solve for the equations of motion using both the Newtonian and Lagrangian formulations.
3.  Simulate and predict complex dynamic behavior of vehicles such as projectiles, aircraft, and spacecraft.
4.  Use MATLAB as a tool for matrix manipulations and dynamic simulation.
5.  Linearize the 6DOF motions associated with most dynamic behavior to establish the basic **modes** of the motion.
